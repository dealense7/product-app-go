### Here's a simplified, step-by-step explanation:

#### Install Air
Run the following command in your terminal to install Air:

```bash
  curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmtrek/air/master/install.sh | sh -s
```

#### Install Project Dependencies
In your project directory, run:

```bash
  npm install
```

This command downloads and installs all required packages.

#### Build Your Assets

To build your CSS and JavaScript files once, run:
```bash
  npm run build
```

If you want the system to automatically update your styles and scripts when you make changes, run:
```bash
  npm run dev
```

#### Start Your Application with Live Reload
Finally, launch the application with live reload by running:

```bash
  ./bin/air
```

This setup ensures that your development environment is ready with live updates every time you make a change.
